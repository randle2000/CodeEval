JOLLY JUMPERS
CHALLENGE DESCRIPTION:

Credits: Programming Challenges by Steven S. Skiena and Miguel A. Revilla 

A sequence of n > 0 integers is called a jolly jumper if the absolute values of the differences between successive elements take on all possible values 1 through n - 1. eg. 
1 4 2 3 
is a jolly jumper, because the absolute differences are 3, 2, and 1, respectively. The definition implies that any sequence of a single integer is a jolly jumper. Write a program to determine whether each of a number of sequences is a jolly jumper. 
INPUT SAMPLE:

Your program should accept as its first argument a path to a filename. Each line in this file is one test case. Each test case will contain an integer n < 3000 followed by n integers representing the sequence. The integers are space delimited.

For example:



1
2
3
4 1 4 2 3
3 7 7 8
9 8 9 7 10 6 12 17 24 38
OUTPUT SAMPLE:

For each line of input generate a line of output saying 'Jolly' or 'Not jolly'.

For example:



1
2
3
Jolly
Not jolly
Not jolly
